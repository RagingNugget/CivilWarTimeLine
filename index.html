            The territory of Missouri wishing to become a slave state would upset the balance between slave and free state senators. As such tension arose, however Henry Clay proposed the Missouri Compromise. The Compromise admitted Missouri (a slave state), and Maine (a free state) as to not upset the balance in congress. Additionally slavery was banned in the rest of the Louisiana purchase above the 36 30 parallel. The event was the first step into the growing division and tension between slave owning states and free states.

            The Republic of Texas Gained its independence from Mexico in 1836. Soon after, the vast majority of its population wished to join the United States. This was realized under James K. Polk’s presidency; where he pushed through legislation to join the United States. However for the the republic Texas was a slave owning state increasing the number of pro-slavery sentors in congress. With this unbalancing new pressure was placed on the anti-slavery senators to add another free state. In addition the disputed border territories in and around Texas threatened war with Mexico.

            The highly controversial Mexican American war started over border conflicts between the US and Mexico. However due to the unjust nature of declaring war over these border conflicts. It required an utmost effort by president James K. Polk to declare the war officially. The war was seen by northerns as another southern attempt to extend slavery. Additionally the war provided valuable military experience to many of the future southern generals. In the end the war reignited tensions over the expansion of slavery, and renewed efforts to reel in southern expansion.

            Following the Mexican American war the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo granted vast lands to the United States of America (525,000 square miles). With the addition of the lands the major question reopened. Would slavery be allowed in these new territories? William Proviso attempted to tack on an amendment to the treaty prohibiting slavery in the new territories. This sparked a national debate over the issue. Which would be solved a few years later in the compromise of 1850.

            Just a  year after the Mexican American war California wished to enter the union as a free state. This would upset the balance in congress, so senator Henry Clay proposed a series of five resolutions to solve the issue of slavery. One, California would enter the United States as a free state. Two, the territories of New Mexico and Utah were able to vote for or against slavery in their state. Three, the district of Columbia banned the slave trade. Four, the federal government would assume $10 million dollars of Texas's debt in return, ceding land to the territories of Utah and New Mexico. Finally povison five strengthened the fugitive slave law by making it federally enforced law. This compromise set the precedent of popular sovereignty to be used in state slavery issues. Additionally it upset the long standing balance in congress, and unilaterally increased tensions between the north and south.

            The original fugitive slave laws established in 1793 required northerners to return escaped slaves back to the southern colonies. Before 1850 the law was rarely exercised to the extent the south wished. However following the compromise of 1850 the fugitive slave law’s enforcement was placed in the hands of the federal government. Northerners became upset at the law, as they were required to participate in its enforcement. Effectively the law increased the divisions between the south and north. Additionally the law inspired more resistance to the southern institution of slavery, and increased interest in abolition on moral grounds.

            Harriet Beecher Stowe published Uncle Tom’s Cabin in 1852. The book was written in response to the provision within the compromise of 1850 giving the duty to all to return escaped slaves to the south. Stowe’s dislike of the law inspired her to write an exposé on slavery. Said exposé was the internationally successful Uncle Tom’s Cabin. The book inspired many northerners to oppose slavery on moral grounds, and unveiled the horrid nature of slavery to the wider world.

              Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois wished for a railway through Chicago. The idea was to aid the growing number of settlers moving west by building a railroad. However if said railroad were created and ran through Illinois it would also have to pass through the remaining unorganized territory from the Louisiana purchase. So Stephen Douglas created two new territories (Kansas and Nebraska) to run the rail through. The sound idea was shot though by southerners because the bill would add two new free states. So Douglas was pressured to add a provision which would repeal the Missouri Compromise and allow popular sovereignty to determine whether the states were slave or not. The bill was decisively disruptive sparking up heavy tension between southerners and northerners. Many pro and anti slavery citizens felt inspired to sway the vote and moved to these new territories.

              Soon after popular sovereignty was declared in Kansas and Nebraska pro slavery peoples from the north flooded in to sway the vote. The same from the south. Acts of violence like that committed by John Brown highlighted the bleeding that occurred in Kansas. Pro slavery and anti-slavery advocates scared, injured, and killed to influence people to vote for their stance. The immediate mass violence committed in Kansa revealed the true hatred the north held for the south and vice versa.

              The “slave” Dred Scott sued for his freedom on the basis that he had lived in a free state for an extended period of time. Therefore his status as a slave was void. He lost his case in the Missouri courts, but tried again to overturn the ruling in the supreme court. Unfortunately for Scott the supreme court of the United States of America ruled that african americans were inherently property, and such were not citizens. So the federal government had no responsibilities in upholding any rights granted to white Americans to blacks (additionally congress had no authority to ban slavery in federal lands). This ruling was outrageous for many; it was an immediate and obvious step towards a civil war.

              John Brown, a veteran of anti-slavery actions in Kansa turned his sights to a more direct effort to ending slavery. Brown theorized and planned to start an all out slave revolt. By seizing the federal arms at Harpers Ferry and distributing them to the enslaved. The formerly enslaved would tear apart the plantation system and slavery would be purged from America. However the plan was far too grand and the raid was a complete failure, with most of Brown's men dying including himself (by the courts). The impact of the raid was Brown was hailed a martyr against slavery by many northerners. Additionally it reinforced the idea that the north wanted to end slavery in the south. The integrity of the union had never been weaker, and the distrust between the two was high.

              The political climate was tense leading up to the election of 1860. New parties were being created and four candidates were running for the presidency. For the people at the time Abraham Lincoln was the only candidate against slavery (in actuality he only wanted to prevent its spread). The others all championed slavery or protected its existence. Although Lincoln acquired less than 50% of the popular vote Linoln won the electoral college with a landslide victory. The results of the election saw the breakup of the union between southern slave owning states and northern free states. The fate of the union rests in the balance, under the leadership of Lincoln.

              With the results of the 1860 election South Carolina became disillusioned with the union. To the peoples of South Carolina (and many other southerners) it seems the north united to elect an abolitionist. South Carolina believed Lincoln would pass legislation disruptive and or destructive to the current way of life in South Carolina. So continuing to participate in the union became impossible, so South Carolina in order to protect their institution of slavery seceded from the union. Lincoln, a staunch supporter of the union, would take action to bring back South Carolina and other succeeding states to union. Military action between northerners and southerners seemed more likely than ever.

              With the secession of the southern states from the former union. Both sides stood off with each other waiting for the first blow. In order to establish independence from the union confederate troops began seizing forts. One of the forts the Confederate troops forcefully seized was Fort Sumter. The seizure of the fortress effectively started the eventual large-scale fighting between the north and the south. The capture of the fort symbolizes the start of the American civil war and the struggle for liberty.
